# Zombie-Defense
Project for Object Oriented Programming, this project got 100 out of 100 score.

Since i wrote this project at my first year of university, code is messy and full of bugs. There are alot of improvements that can be
made and many different parts of the code are written without proper structure since i was an ametour back then and this was my first 
serious project. However i still think that i did quite good job given my lack of experiance at my first year.
